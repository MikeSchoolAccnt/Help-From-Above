# Help-From-Above
Help From Above is an Android app that is used to communicate with a component that is attached to a supported UAS. This component
gives the UAS the ability to follow the user's Android phone by using its GPS location.  
*This application was developed for Team-Projects II at Wright State University during fall semester of 2017.*

**Note:** Attaching the component to a UAS was never fully tested, however, communication between the device and component was tested. The code
for the component is not in this repository or on Github.
