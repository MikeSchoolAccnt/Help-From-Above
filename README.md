# Help-From-Above
Help From Above is an Android app that is used to communicate with a component that is attached to a supported UAS. This component
gives the UAS the ability to follow the user's Android phone by using its GPS location. It also provides images to the user through the application from the camera on the component. These images are saved localy or on a supported cloud service.  
*This application was developed for Team-Projects II at Wright State University during fall semester of 2017.*

**Note:** Attaching the component to a UAS was never fully tested, however, communication between the device and component was tested. The code
for the component is not in this repository or on Github.
